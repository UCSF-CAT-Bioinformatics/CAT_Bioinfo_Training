### Workshop Description:
This 2.5-day in-person workshop includes a half-day of introductory material, followed by two days of focused, in-depth coursework on 10x single-cell RNA-seq. Participants will explore experimental design, data generation, data reduction, and basic analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing data using the command line and the R statistical programming environment. The course will cover software and protocols, workflow creation and modification, and diagnosing/treating problematic data using the command line and R code using Seurat. A basic understanding of the command line and R is highly recommended for success in this course. We will conduct a very brief review on the first morning, but we will not be providing full instruction in basic CLI or R.

### Structure:

* Day 1 (Morning): Introductory Material
* Day 1 (Afternoon): Data reduction using 10X CellRanger and basic QA/QC
* Day 2 to Day 3 (Morning): In-depth R Coursework on scRNA-seq with Suerat.
* Sprinkled within will be talks and conversations, including experimental design, technology usage, and philosophy of analysis.

### Focus Areas:

* Experimental Design
* Data Generation and Processing
* Data Analysis using the R package Seurat.

### Learning Objectives:

* Conduct scRNA-Seq experiments using the command line and R.
* Create and modify Illumina 10X sequencing data processing workflows.
* Diagnose and address problematic data.
 
### Prerequisites

**Recommended:** Basic understanding of the command line (CLI) and R.
**Intermediate Knowledge:** Needed for maximum value from the course.
**Beginners:** Can achieve a thorough understanding but may not be able to independently conduct an experiment.

### Supplies Needed
A laptop with the command line terminal and R/Rstudio preinstalled.

Participants must have access to a computer with a reliable connection to the internet, current versions of [R version 4.4.1, or at least R version >= 4.3.0](https://cloud.r-project.org/) and [Rstudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download), and a terminal application.

We will have a dataset to use for the course, however you can bring your dataset for discussion purposes and feedback.

#### Recommendations for Beginners

Enroll in introductory courses in CLI and/or R courses to get the maximum out of the course.

### Introductory Materials
To get the most out of this course, please complete the prerequisite material in [command line](base/cli_prerequisites) and [R](base/r_prerequisites) before the course, and contact us with any questions.
